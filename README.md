### **Fire Station Allocation Optimization**

📌 **Project Overview**

This project optimizes fire station placement in Izmir to minimize emergency response times. We applied Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Simulated Annealing (SA) to efficiently distribute fire stations while considering fire frequency, travel times, and budget constraints.

⚙️ **Methods Used**

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO): Optimizes fire station allocation by minimizing response time.

Genetic Algorithm (GA): Uses evolutionary principles to optimize resource distribution.

Simulated Annealing (SA): Probabilistically explores optimal station placements.

🛠 **Technologies**

Python

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

🚀 **Getting Started**

Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries. Install dependencies manually:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
